      <p>Understanding the danger of sharing information on the web has become increasingly important during the past years. People not only can see what others publish, but can also be threatened by someone who accessed the data illegally. Types of cyber attack and ways of taking the precautions to avoid them will be deepened by focusing on the importance of passwords and management systems. The aim of the literature review is to inform readers about the danger and give a basic knowledge about the threats. As confirmed by Mr. Pawar, networks design is developed to provide security and inaccessibility to the data while it is transferred from one device to another. There are two main features that it must supply: confidentiality - packets are read only by sender and receiver - and integrity - the guarantee that data will not be altered  (Pawar, M. V., Anuradha, J., 2015).</p>
      <p>The network security is becoming considerable relevant as a result of the growing interconnection of the world, the large amount of data online and the easiness of acquiring intellectual property through the Internet (Pawar, M. V., Anuradha, J., 2015). For instance, when a virus goes through a flaw in a router, domain or switch, it becomes responsible for malfunctioning the whole system. In the worst case, the virus is likely to reach the rest of the network, despite the fact that each computer uses virus scans and domains use firewalls to protect exposure to malware. (Acemoglu, D., Malekian, A., Ozdaglar, A., 2016). Although, the utilization of firewalls could generate other issues. First, it is possible that both application and network are not aware of each other. Secondly,  the interaction with firewalls could be challenging while testing it in a global environment, since the debugging phase is made in a local area (Niederberger, R et. al, 2016).</p>
      <p>Since people have started to store data and information on the cloud facilities, attacks have not been addressed only to traditional infrastructures,indeed the popularity of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks have increased. This type of threats consist of making unavailable services by sending a big amount of requests (overloading the service) through a group of machines (Somani, G et al., 2017). Studies prove that DDoS attacks could hit basing on the protocol targeted, whose can be the transport-level and the application-level. In the first case, a hacker will try to use up the network’s bandwidth and the router processing capacity, sending TCP, UDP, ICMP requests or via a  Smurf attack. In the other case, a hacker will try to exhaust the server resources such as network sockets, CPU and the memory by using DNS, HTTP or SIP protocols (Zargar, S. T., Joshi, J., & Tipper, D, 2013). According to Shameli-Sendi, there are different strategies to protect systems, which are grouped in collaborative or non-collaborative. The main idea of the former involves the usage of more firewalls, that operate and exchange information together, with the aim of blocking undesired attacks to the firewall node.  The latter is distinguished in two categories; Static - that identifies a DDoS via the volume counting and drops malicious information - and dynamic - that filter out the packets and then direct them to the destination. (Shameli-Sendi et al., 2015) An additional severe threat that concerns Internet Security is phishing; it consists of a spoofed website made with the intention of steal user’s details and passwords.  In order to defend against that, organisations and communities like Anti-Phishing Working Group and  APWG have been created and many other secure browsing systems have been made available, such as Google Safe Browsing and McAfee SiteAdvisor. (Zhao, R, 2017)</p>
      <p>Another key point to protect networks is represented by passwords. They are secure thanks to encryption and hash algorithms and they allow legal users to operate safety with the resources found in remote systems. There are three ways of identity authentication defined by information known - passwords, information own -smart cards and some personal characteristic - fingerprint. (Liao, I., Lee, C., Hwang, M.,  2006) Despite the fact passwords are safe, they are a feeble form of protection due to the linkage of the weakest component in the network security: the human user, whom do not pay enough attention to creating a strong password (Kessler, G. C., 1996) Besides, user passwords have different accesses depending upon the authorization level of each user/group within the system. These are managed by the Password Management System, that provides updated passwords on a regular basis. The user ‘root’/’administrator’ has limitless authorizations, implementing whatever task. This system has pros and cons; the bigger disadvantage is found when a super user moves department or quits the company, indeed all his/her privilege must be revoked. Furthermore, systems have to make sure that the employee has not left any backdoor that could use to access data in the future. (Huseyin, T., Kerem, E., 2011)</p>
      <p>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) has gained more and more popularity, meaning that end-users need to be educated as never before. In an organisation, every employee might be taught in basics of cyber-security, indeed the only IT team is not enough if the everyone is not aware of security threats (Kim, J., 2017). Furthermore, the usage of outdated device firmware and insecure protocols leaves several gaps in networks security, meaning that the organisation is vulnerable and wide open to attackers. Although, even if organisations are provided by the best and latest technology, having a team that does not know how to manipulate it properly could lead to mistakes and weaknesses inside the network (Kim, J., 2017).</p>
      <p>As described in this literature review, there is not only one way to minimise risks related to the exposure of data online and there is not any solution to cease them eternally. Organisations have developed strategies as new types of attacks has emerged and spread across the web, jeopardising the security of both end-users and companies of great importance. Teaching people how to behave against these dangers is crucial in order to mitigate them, because cyber security could be attacked in any moment and having employees ready to defend the network can benefit everyone over the company or organisation.</p>
